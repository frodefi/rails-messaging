Installing the gem
==================

Include gems and run the bundle command

````ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'messaging', git: 'git://github.com/frodefi/rails-messaging.git'
gem 'mailboxer', git: 'git://github.com/ging/mailboxer.git'
````

Install messaging

````
$ bundle install
$ rails generate messaging:install
````

*Overwrite model file when asked*

Run migrations

````
$ rake db:migrate
````

Set the default host and set a root route (required for Devise)

````ruby
# config/environments/development.rb
config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => 'localhost:3000' }
````

These steps will work for standard Rails applications. You can access the messaging portion of the site at http://127.0.0.1:3000/messages

Make the rails-messaging work for RefineryCMS 2.0
===============

If you are using refinerycms edge (http://refinerycms.com/edge-guides/) and you want integrate the this gem to your system. Please do the following step:

Remove this line from /config/routes.rb

````ruby
devise_for :messaging_users
````

Replace content of /app/models/messaging_user.rb as below

````ruby
class MessagingUser < Refinery::User

end
````

Create /app/decorators/models/messaging/message_decorator.rb and insert the below content

````ruby
Messaging::Message.class_eval do

  def recipients=(string='')
    @recipient_list = []
    string.split(',').each do |s|
      unless s.blank?
        recipient = Refinery::User.find_by_email(s.strip)
        @recipient_list << recipient if recipient
      end
    end
  end

end
````

Create /app/decorators/models/refinery/user_decorator.rb and insert the below content

````ruby
Refinery::User.class_eval do
  include Mailboxer::Models::Messageable
  acts_as_messageable

  def name
    self.to_s
  end

  def mailboxer_email(message)
    email
  end

  def to_s
    email
  end
end
````

Create /app/decorators/controllers/messaging/application_controller_decorator.rb and insert the below content

````ruby
Messaging::ApplicationController.class_eval do
  skip_filter :authenticate_messaging_user!
  before_filter :login_required
  helper_method :current_messaging_user

  protected
  def login_required
    redirect_to main_app.new_refinery_user_session_path unless current_refinery_user
  end

  def current_messaging_user
    current_refinery_user
  end
end
````

If you want to use refinery's layout, you can add the following lines to app/decorators/controllers/messaging/application_controller_decorator.rb

````ruby
  layout "application"
  include Refinery::AuthenticatedSystem
  include Refinery::ApplicationController::InstanceMethods
  include Refinery::Pages::InstanceMethods
  helper_method :home_page?,
                :local_request?,
                :just_installed?,
                :from_dialog?,
                :admin?,
                :login?
  before_filter  :find_pages_for_menu, :show_welcome_page?
````

And then create app/helpers/messaging/application_helper.rb, with the below content:

````ruby
module Messaging
  module ApplicationHelper
    include Refinery::SiteBarHelper
    include Refinery::MenuHelper
    include Refinery::MetaHelper
  end
end
````

And then create app/views/layout/messaging/application.html.haml file with the below content

````ruby
!!!
= render :partial => '/refinery/html_tag'
- site_bar = render(:partial => '/refinery/site_bar', :locals => {:head => true})
= render :partial => '/refinery/head'

      '980px  to 1280px = #{asset_path('messaging/960.css')}',
      '1280px to 1600px = #{asset_path('messaging/1200.css')}',
      '1600px = #{asset_path('messaging/1560.css')}',
    ]
  };

        %section#body_content_right
          .inner
